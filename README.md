# Evolution of Football Teams

This project explores how football (soccer) teams' compositions have changed across decades. Focusing on several prominent clubs, we gather historical data on player lineups and represent these teams as dynamic graphs—where each node is a player, and edges between nodes indicate players who played together, weighted by the number of matches shared.

The repository includes:
- Data collection scripts and tools for extracting team lineups from reliable sources.
- Algorithms for generating and updating graphs reflecting year-by-year team evolution.
- Documentation of data sources, formats, and methods used.
- Visualization scripts and templates (e.g., with Java GraphStream) for interactive exploration of team history.
- Guidelines for expanding the dataset, contributing, or replicating analyses for other clubs or time periods.

This project is part of a group assignment for the PZE course at UKSW. All data processing is conducted in Python or Java, with justifications for language choices provided in the report. Data sources are always cited, and prompts for any AI tools used are included.
